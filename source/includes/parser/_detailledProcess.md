## Detailled process

```php
<?php
use Weglot\Client\Client;
use Weglot\Parser\Parser;
use Weglot\Parser\ConfigProvider\ServerConfigProvider;

// Url to parse
$url = 'https://foo.bar/baz';

// Config with $_SERVER variables
$config = new ServerConfigProvider();

// Fetching url content
$content = '...';

// Client
$client = new Client(getenv('WG_API_KEY'));
$parser = new Parser($client, $config);

// Run the Parser
$translatedContent = $parser->translate($content, 'en', 'de');
```

How it works:

Once you hit the `translate` function, what the `Parser` does ? Let's explain all steps, step by step:

1. Receiving & setting both original & destination language.
2. Depending on your API version, you'll now pass into `ignoredNodes` formatter. Basically, `ignoredNodes` mode is skip some tags into translations by using HTML entities, like that, we would have less sentences sent to Weglot API.
3. After that, we're using a library called [`simple_html_dom`](https://github.com/weglot/simple_html_dom) (with some internal tweaks) to fetch all HTML content.
4. Then we check if there is blocks you don't want to be translated (through `$excludeBlocks` array that you can set in `Parser` construct). We fetch them all and add a property to make sure we won't translate them (you can find this property in `Parser::ATTRIBUTE_NO_TRANSLATE` constant)
5. From now, the real deal start, we run Checkers. Checkers are used to match elements in HTML and to retrieve strings to translate.
6. And we send all strings without duplicates to API through the [Translate endpoint](#translate) from the library
7. We're getting response with all translated sentences and apply changes to collected HTML nodes from Checkers through Formatters
8. Finally, we're returning all the HTML as string with everything translated !
